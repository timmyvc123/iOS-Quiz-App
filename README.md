# iOS-Quiz-App

A quiz app that asks the user 13 true or false questions. It has a progress bar at the bottom of the storyboard that lets the 
user know what question they're on. There is also a score at the bottom of the right of the story board that tells the user 
how many questions they've gotten correct. Also, after each question an alert pops up saying "correct" or "wrong"depending on 
what the user picked, as well as an alert after all questions have been answered that asks the user if they want to restart. I 
followed video tutorials from the London app brewery through Udemy to create this.
